# Src

**Intent:** Primary source code directory containing all application logic organized by framework modules, project-specific code, and configuration.

**Scope:** Framework modules, project implementation, settings management. NOT tests, documentation, build artifacts, or deployment configurations.

**Dependencies:** Framework modules support project layer, settings configure entire application, consumed by build processes and other/ utilities.

**AI Hint:** Maintain clean separation between reusable modules/ (framework level) and project/ (application specific). All src/ code must follow 250-line file limits and single responsibility.
