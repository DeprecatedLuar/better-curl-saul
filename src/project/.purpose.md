# Project

**Intent:** Application-specific business logic, domain models, and implementation code unique to each individual project built on this framework.

**Scope:** Business rules, domain entities, application workflows, project-specific integrations. NOT framework utilities, cross-cutting concerns, or reusable infrastructure.

**Dependencies:** Uses src/modules for infrastructure services and src/settings for configuration, provides business value to end users and external systems.

**AI Hint:** This is where project uniqueness lives. Focus on business domain concepts, use modules/ for technical concerns. Keep business logic separate from framework infrastructure.
