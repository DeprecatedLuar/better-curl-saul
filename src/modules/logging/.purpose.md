# Logging

**Intent:** Centralized logging system providing consistent log formatting, level management, and output handling for all application components.

**Scope:** Log levels, formatters, transport configuration, structured logging. NOT business event tracking, analytics, or application-specific metrics.

**Dependencies:** Uses settings for log configuration, consumed by all modules and project code, no dependencies on other application modules.

**AI Hint:** MANDATORY: Never create additional logging systems - extend this one only. Use structured logging with consistent formats. Configure via settings, support multiple transports (console, file, etc.).
