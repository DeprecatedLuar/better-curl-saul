# Server

**Intent:** HTTP server initialization, middleware configuration, route setup, and connection management for web applications.

**Scope:** Express server config, middleware chains, route registration, port management. NOT route handlers, business logic, or application-specific endpoints.

**Dependencies:** Uses paths for route discovery, logging for server events, errors for standardized responses, consumed by project-specific route handlers.

**AI Hint:** Handle server lifecycle (start/stop/restart), middleware order is critical, use configuration-driven port/host settings. Centralize server concerns here, delegate request handling to project layer.
