# Modules

**Intent:** Reusable framework components providing core infrastructure services like server management, error handling, path resolution, and logging across all projects.

**Scope:** Cross-cutting concerns, shared utilities, framework infrastructure. NOT project-specific business logic, UI components, or application workflows.

**Dependencies:** Uses src/settings for configuration, provides services to src/project and external applications, zero dependencies on project-specific code.

**AI Hint:** These modules must be pure and reusable across projects. Follow dependency injection patterns, use standardized {success, data, error} responses, maintain framework-level abstraction.
