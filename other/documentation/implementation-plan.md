# Implementation Plan

<!-- WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:
- This file contains active phases for implementation (completed phases moved to implementation-history.md)
- Each phase = one focused session until stable git commit (can be broken down into subphases), follow top-to-bottom order
- Focus on actionable steps: "Update file X, add function Y"
- Avoid verbose explanations - just implement what's specified and valuable
- Success criteria must be testable
- Make sure to test implementation after conclusion of phase
- Stop implementation and call out ideas if you find better approaches during implementation
