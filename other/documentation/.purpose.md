# Documentation

**Intent:** Project documentation, API references, architecture decisions, and development guides for project understanding and onboarding.

**Scope:** API docs, architecture guides, development notes, project overview. NOT code comments (belong in source), configuration documentation (belongs with settings), or reports.

**Dependencies:** Documents src/ architecture and functionality, supports developer onboarding and project maintenance, references framework patterns.

**AI Hint:** Focus on high-level project documentation and guides. Avoid duplicating information available in code or .purpose.md files. Use for architecture decisions and user-facing documentation.
