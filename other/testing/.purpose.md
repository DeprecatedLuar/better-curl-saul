# Testing

**Intent:** Testing utilities, test data, mock configurations, and testing infrastructure supporting comprehensive project testing strategies.

**Scope:** Test utilities, mock data, testing configurations, quality assurance tools. NOT actual test files (those belong with tested code), production code, or source modules.

**Dependencies:** Supports src/ testing requirements, provides testing infrastructure to development workflow, consumed by CI/CD processes.

**AI Hint:** Focus on testing infrastructure and shared testing utilities. Individual test files should live near the code they test. Use for testing configuration and reusable testing components.
