**Intent:** Non-source supporting materials including development reports, testing resources, and documentation that support the development workflow.

**Scope:** Status reports, testing utilities, project documentation, development artifacts. NOT source code, configuration, or deployment assets.

**Dependencies:** References src/ for generating reports and analysis, standalone supporting materials, consumed by development workflow and project management.

**AI Hint:** Keep organized by function (report/, testing/, documentation/). Use for development lifecycle support, never mix with source code. Status tracking follows active/complete pattern.
